Why These Files & Folders?

	•	Anchor is designed to help you organize a Solana program in a standard, predictable way.
	•	Rust code goes in programs/, JavaScript/TypeScript test code goes in tests/.
	•	Config files like Anchor.toml manage your environment, cluster, and program definitions.
	•	package.json, Cargo.toml, and tsconfig.json handle the Node, Rust, and TypeScript dependencies, respectively.

Together, they create a complete development environment for building, testing, and deploying Solana programs, plus any front-end or AI scripts you might add.


ai_trading_bot/
	•	This is your root project folder. Everything Anchor generated lives inside here.
	•	You’ll write the Solana program (the on-chain logic) and any supporting files within this folder.

Programs Folder (programs/)
	•	Purpose: Your actual Solana program (on-chain code) lives here.
	•	High-Level: This is the heart of your project.
	•	Technical Details:
	•	Inside programs/, you’ll have a sub-folder with the same name as your project (e.g., ai_trading_bot), containing:
	•	A Cargo.toml (Rust dependencies for that program).
	•	A src/lib.rs (the main Rust file with your Anchor annotations).
	•	lib.rs is where you’ll define your structs, instructions, and logic like #[program] pub mod ai_trading_bot { ... }.
	•	Each Solana program compiles to a .so (shared object) file.

Tests Folder (tests/)
	•	Purpose: Holds your JavaScript/TypeScript test files that interact with your Solana program.
	•	High-Level: You can write tests using the Anchor testing framework, which spins up a local Solana validator and runs your scripts.
	•	Technical Details:
	•	For example, ai_trading_bot.test.ts might contain code that imports your IDL (Interface Definition Language) and sends instructions to your program to test deposit/withdraw logic.
	•	Anchor’s tests run with mocha, so you’ll see typical describe() and it() blocks.

app/ Folder
•	Purpose: Placeholder for a possible front-end application.
	•	High-Level: If you later build a web UI to interact with your Solana program, you can put it here.
	•	Technical Details:
	•	Anchor doesn’t automatically configure anything inside app/; it’s just scaffolding.
	•	.js, .ts, or .html files might live here if you create a user-facing application.

migrations/ Folder
    Purpose: In some frameworks (like older Truffle for Ethereum or older Anchor setups), “migrations” are scripts that deploy or upgrade your program.
	•	High-Level: If you adopt a pattern of “migrating” from one contract version to another, you’d put scripts here.
	•	Technical Details:
	•	For modern Anchor projects, you might not use migrations/ heavily, since Anchor’s recommended approach is anchor build + anchor deploy.
	•	You can keep custom scripts for advanced upgrade logic or one-time setup tasks.

target/ Folder
    	•	Purpose: Build artifacts from your Rust program get placed here.
	•	High-Level: You’ll rarely touch this manually—Anchor manages it.
	•	Technical Details:
	•	When you run anchor build, Anchor calls Cargo (the Rust build system) to compile your code.
	•	The compiled Solana program .so (shared object) ends up in something like target/deploy/ai_trading_bot.so.
	•	If you look deeper, you’ll see standard Rust build files and logs.


.gitignore
	•	Purpose: Tells Git which files/folders to ignore.
	•	High-Level: Prevents huge or sensitive files (like node_modules/, target/, or private keys) from being committed to version control.
	•	Technical Details:
	•	Usually, target/, node_modules/, and any environment files with private keys (.env) are listed here.
	•	Git will skip tracking these files/folders.

.prettierignore
	•	Purpose: Instructs Prettier (a code formatter) which files to skip.
	•	High-Level: Helps keep your code style consistent across .js, .ts, .json, etc.
	•	Technical Details:
	•	If you have prettier installed, it will automatically format code on save or via a command.
	•	Any file patterns in .prettierignore won’t be formatted automatically.

Anchor.toml
	•	Purpose: Anchor’s main configuration file—like a “settings” file for your entire workspace.
	•	High-Level: Tells Anchor which programs exist, their names, IDs, cluster settings (devnet, mainnet, localnet), etc.
	•	Technical Details:
	•	Example sections:
	•	[programs.localnet] – Program name mapped to a local ID.
	•	[provider] – The default cluster (e.g., localnet, devnet) and the path to your Solana wallet.
	•	When you run anchor build or anchor deploy, Anchor references Anchor.toml.

Cargo.toml (at the root)
	•	Purpose: Rust dependency file for the entire workspace.
	•	High-Level: If your Anchor workspace has multiple Rust programs, each program can also have its own Cargo.toml.

package.json
	•	Purpose: Node.js dependency file if you’re using JavaScript/TypeScript in your tests or for scripting.
	•	High-Level: Similar to Cargo.toml, but for the JavaScript ecosystem.
	•	Technical Details:
	•	Might contain scripts like "test": "anchor test" or "build": "anchor build".
	•	Contains dependencies like @project-serum/anchor, mocha, typescript, etc.

tsconfig.json
	•	Purpose: TypeScript configuration if you’re writing tests or scripts in TypeScript.
	•	High-Level: Tells the TypeScript compiler how to handle files in this project (ES version, module resolution, etc.).
