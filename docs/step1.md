1. Confirm Your Vault Structure and Deposits
	•	Goal: Solidify how users deposit and withdraw tokens from your program.
	•	Why: Ensures you understand the basics of handling SPL tokens in Anchor before adding complex swaps.
	•	Action:
	1.	Create a vault PDA (Program-Derived Address) or have each user create their own vault token account.
	2.	Implement deposit_tokens() and withdraw_tokens() instructions.
	3.	Write tests to confirm tokens move correctly between user accounts and the vault.

Outcome: A stable, tested vault that can hold any SPL token.

2. Implement a Basic Swap (Orca/Raydium Direct)
	•	Goal: Gain experience calling another Solana program (a DEX) via cross-program invocation (CPI).
	•	Why: A direct AMM (like Orca/Raydium) is simpler to integrate than Jupiter aggregator because it’s a single contract with fewer routing complexities.
	•	Action:
	1.	Add a swap_tokens() instruction in your Anchor program.
	2.	Provide the AMM pool accounts (Orca or Raydium) as arguments.
	3.	In the code, CPI into the AMM to swap tokens from your vault’s token account to the desired token.

Outcome: You’ll have a direct on-chain “buy/sell” function, albeit only for tokens supported by the chosen AMM pool.

3. Add Off-Chain Price and Balance Tracking
	•	Goal: Understand cost basis, PNL, and token balances.
	•	Why: This is essential for seeing what you own, and at what cost, in near real-time.
	•	Action:
	1.	Build a script in Python/Node to watch your transactions (via connection.getSignaturesForAddress()) or simply store local logs each time you call swap_tokens().
	2.	Maintain a small database (even a JSON file for now) that records each buy or sell event and the price (fetched from an oracle or aggregator).
	3.	Display current holdings by querying the vault’s token accounts with getTokenAccountBalance, and multiply by current market price from an API (like CoinGecko or Pyth).

Outcome: A local or web-based interface to see “I hold X tokens, bought at $Y cost basis, now worth $Z.”

4. Integrate a DEX Aggregator (Jupiter)
	•	Goal: Access the best possible route across multiple AMMs for any token pair.
	•	Why: Jupiter simplifies token routing, so you only call their program once and let them handle the rest.
	•	Action:
	1.	Switch from a direct Orca/Raydium CPI to a Jupiter CPI.
	2.	Provide the aggregator with input mint, output mint, amount, slippage, etc.
	3.	Jupiter returns the route instructions, which your program executes (or you do it off-chain, depending on your design).

Outcome: A more robust “buy/sell” command that can swap any token pair if liquidity exists, giving you maximum flexibility for an AI-driven strategy.

5. Security and Role Management
	•	Goal: Protect user funds or your own funds in the vault.
	•	Why: You don’t want unauthorized parties to call swap or withdraw.
	•	Action:
	1.	Store an “owner” or “admin” key in your vault’s on-chain account or pass it as a program argument.
	2.	Use checks like #[account(signer)] to ensure only the correct authority triggers swaps or withdrawals.
	3.	Possibly adopt a multi-signature model or add time locks if needed.

Outcome: A secure system ensuring only authorized calls happen.

6. Add AI or Automated Trading Logic
	•	Goal: Automate the buy/sell process based on a strategy or ML model.
	•	Why: This is your ultimate vision—an AI trading bot.
	•	Action:
	1.	Build a Python/Node “bot” that fetches token prices, runs your model, and decides when to trade.
	2.	Whenever the bot wants to trade, it calls your on-chain swap instruction with the chosen token and amount.
	3.	Log each trade in a local DB to keep track of cost basis and PNL.

Outcome: End-to-end AI-driven trading with on-chain execution via your Vault program.

7. Deployment + Testing on Devnet
	•	Goal: Validate your system in near-real conditions.
	•	Why: Ensures everything from vault deposit to aggregator swaps to AI triggers works at scale, with real transaction confirmation times.
	•	Action:
	1.	Deploy your final or near-final program to Devnet.
	2.	Use the faucet to get tokens.
	3.	Test trades under simulated or small real conditions (like a few USDC).
	4.	Watch logs for errors or performance issues.

Outcome: Confidence that your system is stable before considering mainnet.
